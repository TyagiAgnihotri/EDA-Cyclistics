# Exploratory Data Analysis-Cyclistics
**Description**

Exploratory Data Analysis on Google Analytics Cyclist Dataset from Kaggle.

Cleaned & analyzed data for 200k rides out of 4.4M containing 10 columns using Pandas

Created visualizations (scatter plots, pie charts, Sunburst etc.) using Seaborn, matplotlib & Plotly

 Discovered that most riders prefer Classic bikes, short distance trips, Saturday and August for rides
 
 **Outline**
 
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring, investigating and gathering insights from data using statistical measures and visualizations. The objective of EDA is to develop and understanding of data, by uncovering trends, relationships and patterns.

EDA is both a science and an art. On the one hand it requires the knowledge of statistics, visualization techniques and data analysis tools like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn etc. On the other hand, it requires asking interesting questions to guide the investigation and interpreting numbers & figures to generate useful insights.

In this project, I have selected Google Analyst Cyclist Dataset from kaggle to explore and analyze the trip plan of riders. We'll use the the python libraries Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and foliumto do exploratory data analysis on the cyclist dataset.

Below are the outline as well as squential steps taken to dig down to dataset:

Installation of required packages and their upgradation (if required).

Downloading the dataset from kaggle with the help of Kaggle account credential like username and api token.

Performing data preparation and cleaning with Pandas.

Open ended exploratory analysis & visualisation on columns.

Asking & Answering Questions.

Summarizing inferences and drawing conclusions.
